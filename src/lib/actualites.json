I have fantasies that he’s hurting, crying, and all these sad things that should happen to him because he’s not with me anymore.. it does make me feel a little more confident. I think my confidence has been shot down to the lowest level three months ago when my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me telling me, “it’s just not going to work out, i can’t give you what you want, i dont want to be in a relationship with you.” This was my first and only bf… i’m turning 27 in 1 day!\n\nI’m doing a lot better in this past month focusing more on myself and nothing about the future or the past.\n\nBack to this article, texts… ha, i doubt i’ll even get one, but if i did.. it would definitely be a ego boost for me? one way or another? But obviously i’m not replying back as i am trying really hard on the NCR. Like i said, it’s all fantasy of what i think, wish and want him to do during this time… *sad, but it makes me feel better. — maybe i’m just weird…\n\nI wish there was an article to let me know how different guys deal with a relationship that they dumped.",
